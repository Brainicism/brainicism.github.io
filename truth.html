<h2>To put ninja and Ronaldo on the same bracket is laughable. Your problem is that you measure skill and success by monetary gain. A real athlete spends most of their day pushing their mind and body to the limit through training because sport is defined by physical and mental exertion, conditioning, and mastery. As a person that does both game and practice sports (I play semi pro soccer and take ju jitsu) i can confidently say that I would demolish you in any real sport, be it because I have more endurance, conditioning, or simply fast twitch muscle than you.</h2>
